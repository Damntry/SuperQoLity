# SuperQoLity - AI, performance, and QoL changes for Supermarket Together

## Features:

- NPC job coordination. Employees wont go for the same jobs anymore.
- Shelf/storage highlighting functionality, inherited from BetterSMT, with customizable colors. BetterSMT is not needed for this.
- Configurable employee movement speed while the store is closed. Faster and less laggy than the star perk.
- Configurable, faster item transfer to/from shelves, for players and/or employees.
- Many small and not so small performance optimisations to employees (more to come).
- Implemented an employee job scheduler that lets you choose their workload performance.
- Configurable storage priority for employees (labeled/unlabeled/any)
- Configurable employee wait time after finishing a job step.
- Storage employees prioritise the closest box on the floor, instead of random one.
- And tons of bugs I missed.

This mod is multiplayer ready. If a setting has any multiplayer requirements (only hosts, only clients, etc), its description will tell you so.

#### NOTE ABOUT THE SETTINGS

All settings in this mod have base game values by default. You need to edit the config to enable most features.<br />
If you dont have an in-game config manager, I recommend using the BepInEx5 version of BepInEx.ConfigurationManager, as it lets you change settings in-game:<br />

By design and to promote fair play, the host has control over some of the allowed features. If the host doesnt have the mod, or it has the feature disabled, the client wont be able to use it.

### Known bugs:
None.
					The unknown bugs are the ones that keep me up at night.
