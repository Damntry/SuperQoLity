IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS MOD SETTINGS 
All settings have base game values by default, and you need to edit the config to even notice many of this mod features.

If you dont have an in-game config manager, I recommend using the BepInEx5 version of BepInEx.ConfigurationManager, as it lets you change settings on the fly.
